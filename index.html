    <p>My two coauthors and I created a website where we ranked used lists to rank our favorite and least favorite
      fantasy characters using html. We had not yet learned about CSS files so all CSS properties were implemented
      inline </p>

    <p>My coauthor and I created a faux-cupcake shop website using html. We used a CSS file for formatting</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Background and Education</h3>
    <p>My background and education has always been technology based and somewhat coding adjacent. Up until recently,
      I had been employed with <a href="https://www.vanguard-security.net/">Vanguard Security Inc.,</a> based ouf of
      Los Angeles, California. We worked mainly in high-end estate and residential security. I had worked with the
      company since its start in 2010. I have held many titles within the company from Lead Technician, Project
      Manager, and even Director of Technology.
    </p>
    <p>I have work with many different types of security and security adjacent systems such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Alarm Systems</li>
      <li>CCTV (Networked and analog)</li>
      <li>Access Control</li>
      <li>Perimeter Detection and Deterrent</li>
      <li>Intercoms</li>
      <li>Phone Systems</li>
      <li>Networking</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I have alway been a bit underwhelmed by the lack of cross communications between the aforementioned technologies
      and thought, this is something I would like to learn about and potentially bridge the gap. To say these devices
      do
      not communicate with one another is inaccurate but the interface is a bit cumbersome. I have done hundreds, if
      not
      thousands, of walkthroughs with clients and have noticed a pattern of complaints that I would love to fix.
